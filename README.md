# Reading list in Transformer

[AI Conference Deadlines](https://aideadlin.es/)


We are a team from KAUST [Vision-CAIR group](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/vision-cair) and focus on the Multi-modal representation learning. 

This repo is to collect all the recent popular Transformer paper and code related to the domains of **Vision Transformer**, **NLP** and **multi-modal**, etc.  
It also collects the related learning materials.
